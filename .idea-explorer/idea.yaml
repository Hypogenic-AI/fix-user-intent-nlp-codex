  title: "\u201CDo You Mean\u2026?\u201D: Fixing User Intent Without Annoying Them"
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: "Autocomplete and intent detection systems often incorrectly correct\
    \ user input in ways that alter the intended meaning. Evaluating and improving\
    \ intent preservation\u2014ensuring that model rewrites or clarifications maintain\
    \ the user's original goal\u2014can lead to better user experiences. It is possible\
    \ to design clarification mechanisms that improve intent preservation without\
    \ overwhelming users with excessive questions.\n"
  background:
    description: "Autocomplete and intent detection systems can be helpful or infuriating.\
      \ How often do models incorrectly \u201Ccorrect\u201D users in a way that changes\
      \ the intent? Can we evaluate intent preservation: when the model rewrites a\
      \ query or instruction, does it keep the user\u2019s goal? And can we design\
      \ a method that improves clarification behavior without spamming questions?"
